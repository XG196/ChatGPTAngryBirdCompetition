Environment\nThere are three block types as follows:\nb11, a square block whose width is 1 unit and height is 1 unit\nb31, a horizontal block whose width is 3 units and height is 1 unit\nb13, a vertical block whose width is 1 unit and height is 3 units\n\n4. Tool\nUse the following function to vertically drop a block from layer H such that its center is at slot x_position and drop earlier blocks representing more bottom parts of the structure.\ndrop_block(block_type: str, x_position: int),\nwhere block_type is a block type, and x_position is the slot number from 0 to W-1 where the block center is aligned.
