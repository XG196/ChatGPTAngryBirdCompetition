To implement the drop_block() function to generate a stable structure that looks like the character A and meets all the hard constraints, we need to carefully plan the dropping positions and orders of the block types b11, b31, and b13. The structure of the character A can be broken down into the following pattern:
- b31 at the top center
- b13 below the b31, slightly shifted to the left
- b13 below the b31, slightly shifted to the right
- b11 at the bottom center

We can use the drop_block() function in a strategic manner to achieve this structure while satisfying all the constraints.

Here's how we can approach this task:
1. Begin by dropping the b31 block at the top center (x_position = 10) by calling drop_block('b31', 10).
2. Drop the two b13 blocks below the b31, one slightly shifted to the left (x_position = 8) and the other slightly shifted to the right (x_position = 12).
3. Finally, drop the b11 block at the bottom center (x_position = 10).

By following this sequence of drop_block() function calls, we can create a stable structure resembling the character A that meets all the hard constraints. Remember to adjust the x_position values to ensure proper alignment and avoid boundary intrusion.
