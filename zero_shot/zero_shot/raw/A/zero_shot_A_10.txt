To implement the drop_block() function to generate a stable structure that looks like the character A and meets all the hard constraints, we need to carefully plan the dropping positions and orders of the block types b11, b31, and b13. The structure must be stable, meaning that each block is supported by the base or other blocks beneath it.

Here is a possible solution using the drop_block() function:

1. Start by dropping a b11 block at slot 9 (center) to form the top of the A shape.
2. Drop a b31 block at slot 8 to form the middle part of the A shape.
3. Drop another b11 block at slot 7 to complete the top part of the A shape.
4. Next, drop a b13 block at slot 8 to form the left leg of the A shape.
5. Finally, drop another b13 block at slot 10 to form the right leg of the A shape.

By carefully dropping the blocks in this order and position, the structure should resemble the character A while meeting all the hard constraints and being stable. Adjusting the position and order of the blocks may be necessary to achieve the desired structure.
