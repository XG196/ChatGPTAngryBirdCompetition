To implement the drop_block() function to generate a stable structure that looks like the character A and meets all the hard constraints, we need to carefully plan the dropping positions and orders of the block types b11, b31, and b13. The structure of the character A can be broken down into the following pattern:
- b31 at the top center
- b13 below the b31, slightly shifted to the left
- b13 below the b31, slightly shifted to the right
- b11 at the bottom center

We can use the drop_block() function in a strategic manner to achieve this structure while satisfying all the constraints.

Here's how we can approach this:

1. Drop b31 block:
First, we drop the b31 block at the top center of the map (x_position = 10), ensuring that it is centered horizontally.

2. Drop two b13 blocks:
Next, we drop two b13 blocks below the b31 block. One block is shifted to the left (x_position = 8), and the other block is shifted to the right (x_position = 12).

3. Drop b11 block:
Finally, we drop the b11 block at the bottom center of the map (x_position = 10), ensuring that it is centered horizontally below the two b13 blocks.

By carefully selecting the x_position values and following the dropping order described above, we can create a stable structure that resembles the character A while adhering to all the hard constraints. The drop_block() function can be called in the specified order to achieve the desired structure efficiently.
