To implement the drop_block() function to generate a structure that looks like the character A and meets all the hard constraints, we need to carefully plan the dropping positions and order of the blocks. Here is a step-by-step guide to achieve this:

1. Start by dropping the 'b13' block at slot 9 to form the left side of the 'A' shape. The center of the block should be aligned with slot 9.

```python
drop_block('b13', 9)
```

2. Next, drop the 'b31' block at slot 8 to connect the top part of the 'A' shape with the left side.

```python
drop_block('b31', 8)
```

3. Drop another 'b31' block at slot 10 to connect the top part of the 'A' shape with the right side.

```python
drop_block('b31', 10)
```

4. Finally, drop the 'b13' block at slot 9 to form the right side of the 'A' shape.

```python
drop_block('b13', 9)
```

After following these steps, the structure should resemble the character 'A' and meet all the hard constraints. Make sure to adjust the dropping positions and order as needed to ensure stability and proper alignment.
