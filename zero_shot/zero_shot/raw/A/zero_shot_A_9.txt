To implement the drop_block() function to generate a stable structure that looks like the character A and meets all the hard constraints, we need to carefully plan the dropping positions and orders of the block types b11, b31, and b13. The structure of the character A can be broken down into the following pattern:
- b31 at the top center
- b13 below the b31, slightly shifted to the left
- b13 below the b31, slightly shifted to the right
- b11 at the bottom center

Here's a general algorithm to achieve this structure using the drop_block() function:

1. Start by dropping the b31 block at the top center of the map (slot 9) using drop_block('b31', 9).
2. Drop the two b13 blocks below the b31, slightly shifted to the left and right of the center (slots 6 and 12) using drop_block('b13', 6) and drop_block('b13', 12).
3. Finally, drop the b11 block at the bottom center of the map (slot 9) using drop_block('b11', 9).

By following this specific dropping order and position, you can achieve a stable structure that looks like the character A and meets all the hard constraints. You can adjust the slot positions and block types according to your desired output.
