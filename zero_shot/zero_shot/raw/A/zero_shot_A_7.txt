To implement the drop_block() function to generate a stable structure resembling the character A, we can follow these steps:

1. Drop a b13 block (vertical block) centered at slot 6.
2. Drop a b13 block centered at slot 14.
3. Drop a b31 block (horizontal block) centered at slot 10.
4. Drop a b11 block (square block) centered at slot 10.

By following these steps, we can create a stable structure that looks like the character A and meets all the hard constraints. The drop_block() function takes care of determining the dropping position and order to ensure a stable structure while avoiding boundary intrusion.
