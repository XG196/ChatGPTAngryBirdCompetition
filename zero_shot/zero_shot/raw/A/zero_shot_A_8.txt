5.2 Stability: The structure should be stable, meaning that no block should be left hanging in the air without any support underneath it.

5.3 Goal: The final structure should resemble the character A. The specific arrangement of blocks to form the shape of A is the goal of this task.

6. Objective:
Using the `drop_block()` function, construct a stable structure that resembles the character A while satisfying all the hard constraints mentioned above.

7. Approach:
1. Begin by dropping the bottom horizontal block (b31) at the center of the map (slot 10) to form the base of the A shape.
2. Next, drop the vertical block (b13) on top of the base block slightly to the left (slots 9, 10, 11) to form the left leg of the A shape.
3. Then, drop another vertical block (b13) on top of the base block slightly to the right (slots 11, 12, 13) to form the right leg of the A shape.
4. Lastly, drop the top horizontal block (b31) on top of the two vertical blocks in the center (slots 9, 10, 11) to complete the structure resembling the character A.

By following this approach and carefully selecting the drop positions and order, you can achieve a stable structure that meets the goal and satisfies all the hard constraints.
