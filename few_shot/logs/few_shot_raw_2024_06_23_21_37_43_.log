Environment\nThere are three block types as follows:\nb11, a square block whose width is 1 unit and height is 1 unit\nb31, a horizontal block whose width is 3 units and height is 1 unit\nb13, a vertical block whose width is 1 unit and height is 3 units\n\n4. Tool\nUse the following function to vertically drop a block from layer H such that its center is at slot x_position and drop earlier blocks representing more bottom parts of the structure.\ndrop_block(block_type: str, x_position: int),\nwhere block_type is a block type, and x_position is the slot number from 0 to W-1 where the block center is aligned.

[2024-06-23 21:37:58] Messages: [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Use `drop_block()` function to generate a stable structure that looks like the character L—the goal—and meets all the hard constraints. Dropping position and order are crucial, and they must be determined using techniques in the block-stacking problem.\n\n1. Role\nYou are a player of the Tetris game who aims to generate a structure that meets the goal while satisfying all the hard constraints.\n\n2. Definitions\nSlots: The map\'s width is equally partitioned into W slots where W = 20, with slots 0 and 19 being the most left and right, respectively.\nLayers: The map\'s height is equally partitioned into H layers where H = 16, with layers 0 and 15 being the bottom and top layers, respectively.\nBase: The bottom of the map, i.e., layer 0.\nMap Initialization:\n# initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid\nstructure = [[\' \']*W for _ in range(H)]\n\n3. Environment\nThere are three block types as follows:\nb11, a square block whose width is 1 unit and height is 1 unit\nb31, a horizontal block whose width is 3 units and height is 1 unit\nb13, a vertical block whose width is 1 unit and height is 3 units\n\n4. Tool\nUse the following function to vertically drop a block from layer H such that its center is at slot x_position and drop earlier blocks representing more bottom parts of the structure.\ndrop_block(block_type: str, x_position: int),\nwhere block_type is a block type, and x_position is the slot number from 0 to W-1 where the block center is aligned.  After vertically falling down, the block will end up at either the layer on top of the base or a previously dropped block. This function is defined as follows:\ndef drop_block(block_type: str, x_position: int):\n    # block_type is the block type, x_position is the slot number from 0 to W-1 where the block center is aligned\n\n    # initialize the drop position at the top of the map\n    drop_pos = (H-1, x_position)\n\n    # drop the block from the top and move it down until it lands on the base or another block\n    while drop_pos[0] > 0:\n        drop_pos = (drop_pos[0]-1, x_position)\n        if structure[drop_pos[0]+1][drop_pos[1]] != \' \':\n            break\n\n    # place the block on the structure\n    structure[drop_pos[0]][drop_pos[1]] = block_type\n\n5.
