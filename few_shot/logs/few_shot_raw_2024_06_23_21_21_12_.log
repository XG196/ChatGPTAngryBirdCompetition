Environment\nThere are three block types as follows:\nb11, a square block whose width is 1 unit and height is 1 unit\nb31, a horizontal block whose width is 3 units and height is 1 unit\nb13, a vertical block whose width is 1 unit and height is 3 units\n\n4. Tool\nUse the following function to vertically drop a block from layer H such that its center is at slot x_position and drop earlier blocks representing more bottom parts of the structure.\ndrop_block(block_type: str, x_position: int),\nwhere block_type is a block type, and x_position is the slot number from 0 to W-1 where the block center is aligned.  After vertically falling down, the block will end up at either the layer on top of the base or a previously dropped block. This function is defined as follows:\ndef drop_block(block_type: str, x_position: int):\n    # block_type is the block type, x_position is the slot number from 0 to W-1 where the block center is aligned\n\n    # initialize the drop position at the top of the map\n    drop_pos = (H-1, x_position)\n\n    # drop the block from the top and move it down until it lands on the base or another block\n    while drop_pos[0] > 0:\n        drop_pos = (drop_pos[0]-1, x_position)\n        if structure[drop_pos[0]+1][drop_pos[1]] != \' \':\n            break\n\n    # place the block on the structure\n    structure[drop_pos[0]][drop_pos[1]] = block_type\n\n5. Constraints:\nThe relevant constraints are given in the following.\n\n5.1 No boundary intrusion: This is a soft constraint that should be met if possible. Namely, blocks should not intrude on the boundary of the map. In other words, the area of intrusion regions should be zero.\n\n6. Examples\n\n6.1.
